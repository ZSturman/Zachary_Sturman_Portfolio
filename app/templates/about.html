                <h4>Why Software Development and Data Science?</h4>
                <p>
                    My interest into software engineering began with an enthusiasm for creative problem-solving. Drawn initially to Python for its versatility in Blender for 3D animations, This initial engagement with Python opened the door to the broader possibilities of software development, leading me to explore this field more deeply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside software development, my interest in data science grew, driven by the power of data visualization and analysis. This expanded my skill set beyond traditional programming, allowing me to extract and interpret complex data patterns and transform them into insightful visual narratives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating software development with data science has defined my professional growth. It's this combination of creative coding in software engineering and analytical rigor in data science that enables me to develop innovative, data-driven solutions and applications.
