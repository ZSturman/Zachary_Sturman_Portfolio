Curious but don't know where to start?

{% set body %}
If you're like me then there are a lot of things that interest you. Probably too many things. So many things that you don't know where to start.
<br>
<br>
That's where I can help.
<br>
<br>
I've created a "spin the globe, close your eyes, stop with your finger" kind of app that gets you to a good starting point on your journey to squelch the "-but why?" voice in your head.
